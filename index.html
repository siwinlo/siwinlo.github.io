    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
 I'm an inquisitive and quick-thinking software developer specializing in React, Node, and Javascript. As a former art historian, my background in doctoral-level qualitative and image-based research informs my passion for building effective solutions with user-experience in mind. I am currently a
      teaching fellow at the Grace Hopper Program, a 17-week software
      engineering immersive at Fullstack Academy of Code in New York. I am
      seeking front-end or full stack opportunities on innovative engineering
      teams that value creativity and community. In my spare time, I like to go
      rockclimbing.
    </p>
    <p>Skills:</p>
    <li>
      Proficient: Javascript, React, React Native, Redux, Node, Express,
      Sequelize, SQL, Postgres, Git, HTML/CSS
    </li>
    <li>
      Knowledgable: SQL, AWS RDS, AWS Lambda, Serverless, Mocha, Chai, Enzyme,
      Typescript
    </li>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://youtu.be/0EBBcBKeCWc">Roamie</a> is a travel companion
      mobile app that provides suggestions on places and activities to explore
      and record. Built using React Native, Redux, Express, Sequelize,
      PostgreSQL, AWS RDS, Git, GitHub, Heroku, Google Maps API, Yelp API.
      Roamie was collaboratively built by myself and 3 engineers at Grace
      Hopper. I designed and implemented UI and back-end integrations for user authentication/OAuth and user preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://siwinlo.github.io/Artopod/">Artopod </a>is a single-page
      progressive web application built using React, Redux, Express, Sequelize,
      AWS Lambda, AWS RDS, Heroku, and Github Projects. Perfect for a New York
      paced lunch hour or an afternoon exploring a new neighborhood, and
      inspired by location-based apps like Tinder and Yelp, Artopod helps users
      find art exhibitions close by without the overwhelming choice and
      cumbersome nature of traditional listings. Artopod was researched and
      built solely by myself over the course of 4 days.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://octopuss-garden.herokuapp.com/">Octopus's Garden </a>is
      an ecommerce platform providing aquatic plants built using React, Redux,
      CSS flexbox/grids, Google OAuth; RESTful API built using Express,
      Sequelize, and PostgreSQL, and the result of my collaboration with 3
      engineers at Grace Hopper. We implemented Agile principles and test-driven
      development using Mocha, Chai, and Enzyme. I designed models and schemas, implemented database persistent cart functionality, and built  user profile, past orders, and order submission React components.

    <p>
      <a href="https://siwinlo.github.io/WhatShouldISeeThisWeek/"
        >What Should I See This Week</a
      >
      is a React app that picks a random show for you to see this week from an
      external API. Built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS in addition to React,
      this app is mobile-responsive, allowing you to spontaneously pick an art
      exhibition on any device.
